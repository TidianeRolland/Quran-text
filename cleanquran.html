When you contract a loan for a fixed period of time, commit it to writing. Let the scribe maintain justice between the parties. The scribe should not refuse to write as Allah has taught them to write. They will write what the debtor dictates, bearing Allah in mind and not defrauding the debt. If the debtor is incompetent, weak, or unable to dictate, let their guardian dictate for them with justice. Call upon two of your men to witness.

This is more just &#761;for you&#762; in the sight of Allah, and more convenient to establish evidence and remove doubts. However, if you conduct an immediate transaction among yourselves, then there is no need for you to record it, but call upon witnesses when a deal is finalized. Let no harm come to the scribe or witnesses. If you do, then you have gravely exceeded &#761;your limits&#762;. Be mindful of Allah, for Allah &#761;is the One Who&#762; teaches you.

Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. Should you disagree on anything, then refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if you &#761;truly&#762; believe in Allah and the Last Day. This is the best and fairest resolution.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Have you &#761;O Prophet&#762; not seen those who claim they believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you? They seek the judgment of false judges, which they were commanded to reject. And Satan &#761;only&#762; desires to lead them farther away.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">When it is said to them, &ldquo;Come to Allah&rsquo;s revelations and to the Messenger,&rdquo; you see the hypocrites turn away from you stubbornly.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">How &#761;horrible&#762; will it be if a disaster strikes them because of what their hands have done, then they come to you swearing by Allah, &ldquo;We intended nothing but goodwill and reconciliation.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">&#761;Only&#762; Allah knows what is in their hearts. So turn away from them, caution them, and give them advice that will shake their very souls.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">We only sent messengers to be obeyed by Allah&rsquo;s Will. If only those &#761;hypocrites&#762; came to you &#761;O Prophet&#762;&mdash;after wronging themselves&mdash;seeking Allah&rsquo;s forgiveness and the Messenger prayed for their forgiveness, they would have certainly found Allah ever Accepting of Repentance, Most Merciful.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">But no!

They can hardly comprehend anything!</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Whatever good befalls you is from Allah and whatever evil befalls you is from yourself.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt199" id="ftnt_ref199">[199]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;We have sent you &#761;O Prophet&#762; as a messenger to &#761;all&#762; people.

Allah records all their schemes. So turn away from them, and put your trust in Allah. And Allah is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Had it been from anyone other than Allah, they would have certainly found in it many inconsistencies.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And when they hear news of security or fear,</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt200" id="ftnt_ref200">[200]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;they publicize it.

Had it not been for Allah&rsquo;s grace and mercy, you would have followed Satan&mdash;except for a few.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So fight in the cause of Allah &#761;O Prophet&#762;. You are accountable for none but yourself. And motivate the believers &#761;to fight&#762;, so perhaps Allah will curb the disbelievers&rsquo; might. And Allah is far superior in might and in punishment.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a share in the reward, and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a share in the burden. And Allah is Watchful over all things.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And when you are greeted, respond with a better greeting or at least similarly. Surely Allah is a &#761;vigilant&#762; Reckoner of all things.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Allah, there is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Him.

And whose word is more truthful than Allah&rsquo;s?</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Why are you &#761;believers&#762; divided into two groups regarding the hypocrites while Allah allowed them to regress &#761;to disbelief&#762; because of their misdeeds? Do you wish to guide those left by Allah to stray? And whoever Allah leaves to stray, you will never find for them a way.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They wish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you may all be alike. So do not take them as allies unless they emigrate in the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and do not take any of them as allies or helpers,</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt201" id="ftnt_ref201">[201]</a></sup></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">except those who are allies of a people you are bound with in a treaty or those wholeheartedly opposed to fighting either you or their own people.

We have given you full permission over such people.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">It is not lawful for a believer to kill another except by mistake.

And if the victim is from a people bound with you in a treaty, then blood-money must be paid to the family along with freeing a believing slave. Those who are unable, let them fast two consecutive months&mdash;as a means of repentance to Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And whoever kills a believer intentionally, their reward will be Hell&mdash;where they will stay indefinitely.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt202" id="ftnt_ref202">[202]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Allah will be displeased with them, condemn them, and will prepare for them a tremendous punishment.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">O believers! When you struggle in the cause of Allah, be sure of who you fight.

And they will testify against themselves that they were disbelievers.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">This &#761;sending of the messengers&#762; is because your Lord would never destroy a society for their wrongdoing while its people are unaware &#761;of the truth&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They will each be assigned ranks according to their deeds.

And I know from Allah what you do not know.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Do you find it astonishing that a reminder should come to you from your Lord through one of your own, warning you, so you may beware and perhaps be shown mercy?&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">But they rejected him, so We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and drowned those who rejected Our signs. They were certainly a blind people.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And to the people of &rsquo;&Acirc;d We sent their brother H&ucirc;d. He said, &ldquo;O my people! Worship Allah&mdash;you have no other god except Him. Will you not then fear Him?&rdquo; </span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">The disbelieving chiefs of his people responded, &ldquo;We surely see you as a fool, and we certainly think you are a liar.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">H&ucirc;d replied, &ldquo;O my people! I am no fool! But I am a messenger from the Lord of all worlds,</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">conveying to you my Lord&rsquo;s messages. And I am your sincere advisor.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Do you find it astonishing that a reminder should come to you from your Lord through one of your own so he may warn you? Remember that He made you successors after the people of Noah and increased you greatly in stature. So remember Allah&rsquo;s favours, so you may be successful.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They said, &ldquo;Have you come to us so that we would worship Allah alone and abandon what our forefathers used to worship? Then bring us what you threaten us with, if what you say is true!&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He said, &ldquo;You will certainly be subjected to your Lord&rsquo;s torment and wrath. Do you dispute with me regarding the so-called gods which you and your forefathers have made up&mdash;a practice Allah has never authorized? Then wait! I too am waiting with you.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c6">So We saved him and those with him by Our mercy and uprooted those who denied Our signs. They were not believers.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And to the people of Tham&ucirc;d We sent their brother &#7778;&acirc;li&#7717;. He said, &ldquo;O my people! Worship Allah&mdash;you have no other god except Him. A clear proof has come to you from your Lord: this is Allah&rsquo;s she-camel as a sign to you. So leave her to graze &#761;freely&#762; on Allah&rsquo;s land and do not harm her, or else you will be overcome by a painful punishment.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Remember when He made you successors after &rsquo;&Acirc;d and established you in the land&mdash;&#761;and&#762; you built palaces on its plains and carved homes into mountains. So remember Allah&rsquo;s favours, and do not go about spreading corruption in the land.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">The arrogant chiefs of his people asked the lowly who believed among them, &ldquo;Are you certain that &#7778;&acirc;li&#7717; has been sent by his Lord?&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;We certainly believe in what he has been sent with.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">The arrogant said, &ldquo;We surely reject what you believe in.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Then they killed the she-camel&mdash;defying their Lord&rsquo;s command&mdash;and challenged &#761;&#7778;&acirc;li&#7717;&#762;, &ldquo;Bring us what you threaten us with, if you are &#761;truly&#762; one of the messengers.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Then an &#761;overwhelming&#762; earthquake struck them, and they fell lifeless in their homes.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So he turned away from them, saying, &ldquo;O my people! Surely I conveyed to you my Lord&rsquo;s message and gave you &#761;sincere&#762; advice, but you do not like &#761;sincere&#762; advisors.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And &#761;remember&#762; when Lot scolded &#761;the men of&#762; his people, &#761;saying,&#762; &ldquo;Do you commit a shameful deed that no man has ever done before?</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">You lust after men instead of women! You are certainly transgressors.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">But his people&rsquo;s only response was to say, &ldquo;Expel them from your land! They are a people who wish to remain chaste!&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So We saved him and his family except his wife, who was one of the doomed.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">We poured upon them a rain &#761;of brimstone&#762;. See what was the end of the wicked!</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And to the people of Midian We sent their brother Shu&rsquo;aib. He said, &ldquo;O my people! Worship Allah&mdash;you have no other god except Him. A clear proof has already come to you from your Lord. So give just measure and weight, do not defraud people of their property, nor spread corruption in the land after it has been set in order. This is for your own good, if you are &#761;truly&#762; believers.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And do not lie in ambush on every road&mdash;threatening and hindering those who believe in Allah from His Path and striving to make it &#761;appear&#762; crooked. Remember when you were few, then He increased you in number. And consider the fate of the corruptors!</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">If some of you do believe in what I have been sent with while others do not, then be patient until Allah judges between us. He is the Best of Judges.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">The arrogant chiefs of his people threatened, &ldquo;O Shu&rsquo;aib! We will certainly expel you and your fellow believers from our land, unless you return to our faith.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Even if we hate it?</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">We would surely be fabricating a lie against Allah if we were to return to your faith after Allah has saved us from it. It does not befit us to return to it unless it is the Will of Allah, our Lord. Our Lord has encompassed everything in &#761;His&#762; knowledge. In Allah we trust. Our Lord! Judge between us and our people with truth. You are the best of those who judge.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">The disbelieving chiefs of his people threatened, &ldquo;If you follow Shu&rsquo;aib, you will surely be losers!&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Then an &#761;overwhelming&#762; earthquake struck them and they fell lifeless in their homes.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Those who rejected Shu&rsquo;aib were &#761;wiped out&#762; as if they had never lived there. Those who rejected Shu&rsquo;aib were the true losers.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He turned away from them, saying, &ldquo;O my people! Indeed, I have delivered to you the messages of my Lord and gave you &#761;sincere&#762; advice. How can I then grieve for those who chose to disbelieve?&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Whenever We sent a prophet to a society, We afflicted its &#761;disbelieving&#762; people with suffering and adversity, so perhaps they would be humbled.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Then We changed their adversity to prosperity until they flourished and argued &#761;falsely&#762;, &ldquo;Our forefathers &#761;too&#762; had been visited by adversity and prosperity.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt298" id="ftnt_ref298">[298]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;So We seized them by surprise, while they were unaware.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Had the people of those societies been faithful and mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;, We would have overwhelmed them with blessings from heaven and earth. But they disbelieved, so We seized them for what they used to commit.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Did the people of those societies feel secure that Our punishment would not come upon them by night while they were asleep?</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Or did they feel secure that Our punishment would not come upon them by day while they were at play?</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Did they feel secure against Allah&rsquo;s planning? None would feel secure from Allah&rsquo;s planning except the losers.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Is it not clear to those who take over the land after &#761;the destruction of&#762; its former residents that&mdash;if We will&mdash;We can punish them &#761;too&#762; for their sins and seal their hearts so they will not hear &#761;the truth&#762;?</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">We have narrated to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; some of the stories of those societies. Surely, their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but still they would not believe in what they had already denied. This is how Allah seals the hearts of the disbelievers.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">We did not find most of them true to their covenant. Rather, We found most of them truly rebellious.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Then after them We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them. See what was the end of the corruptors!</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And Moses said, &ldquo;O Pharaoh! I am truly a messenger from the Lord of all worlds,</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">obliged to say nothing about Allah except the truth. Indeed, I have come to you with clear proof from your Lord, so let the children of Israel go with me.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Pharaoh said, &ldquo;If you have come with a sign, then bring it if what you say is true.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So Moses threw down his staff and&mdash;behold!&mdash;it became a real snake.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Then he drew his hand &#761;out of his collar&#762; and it was &#761;shining&#762; white for all to see.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">The chiefs of Pharaoh&rsquo;s people said, &ldquo;He is indeed a skilled magician,</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">who seeks to drive you from your land.&rdquo; &#761;So Pharaoh asked,&#762; &ldquo;What do you propose?&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They replied, &ldquo;Let him and his brother wait and send mobilizers to all cities</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">to bring you every clever magician.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">The magicians came to Pharaoh, saying, &ldquo;Shall we receive a &#761;suitable&#762; reward if we prevail?&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He replied, &ldquo;Yes, and you will certainly be among those closest to me.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They asked, &ldquo;O Moses! Will you cast, or shall we be the first to cast?&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Moses said, &ldquo;You first.&rdquo; So when they did, they deceived the eyes of the people, stunned them, and made a great display of magic.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Then We inspired Moses, &ldquo;Throw down your staff,&rdquo; and&mdash;behold!&mdash;it devoured the objects of their illusion!</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So the truth prevailed and their illusions failed.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So Pharaoh and his people were defeated right there and put to shame.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And the magicians fell down, prostrating.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They declared, &ldquo;We &#761;now&#762; believe in the Lord of all worlds&mdash;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">the Lord of Moses and Aaron.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Pharaoh threatened, &ldquo;How dare you believe in him before I give you permission? This must be a conspiracy you devised in the city to drive out its people, but soon you will see.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, then crucify you all.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They responded, &ldquo;Surely to our Lord we will &#761;all&#762; return.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Your rage towards us is only because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us. Our Lord! Shower us with perseverance, and let us die while submitting &#761;to You&#762;.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt299" id="ftnt_ref299">[299]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">The chiefs of Pharaoh&rsquo;s people protested, &ldquo;Are you going to leave Moses and his people free to spread corruption in the land and abandon you and your gods?&rdquo; He responded, &ldquo;We will kill their sons and keep their women.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt300" id="ftnt_ref300">[300]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;We will completely dominate them.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Moses reassured his people, &ldquo;Seek Allah&rsquo;s help and be patient. Indeed, the earth belongs to Allah &#761;alone&#762;. He grants it to whoever He chooses of His servants. The ultimate outcome belongs &#761;only&#762; to the righteous.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They complained, &ldquo;We have always been oppressed&mdash;before and after you came to us &#761;with the message&#762;.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Perhaps your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors in the land to see what you will do.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Indeed, We afflicted Pharaoh&rsquo;s people with famine and shortage of crops so they might come back &#761;to their senses&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">In times of prosperity, they said, &ldquo;This is what we deserve,&rdquo; but in adversity, they blamed it on Moses and those with him.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt301" id="ftnt_ref301">[301]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Surely all is destined by Allah. Yet most of them did not know.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They said, &ldquo;No matter what sign you may bring to deceive us, we will never believe in you.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So We plagued them with floods, locusts, lice, frogs, and blood&mdash;all as clear signs, but they persisted in arrogance and were a wicked people.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">When tormented, they pleaded, &ldquo;O Moses! Pray to your Lord on our behalf, by virtue of the covenant He made with you. If you help remove this torment from us, we will certainly believe in you and let the Children of Israel go with you.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">But as soon as We removed the torment from them&mdash;until they met their inevitable fate</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt302" id="ftnt_ref302">[302]</a></sup><span class="c0">&mdash;they broke their promise.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So We inflicted punishment upon them, drowning them in the sea for denying Our signs and being heedless of them.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And &#761;so&#762; We made the oppressed people successors of the eastern and western lands, which We had showered with blessings. &#761;In this way&#762; the noble Word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel for what they had endured. And We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people constructed and what they established.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">We brought the Children of Israel across the sea and they came upon a people devoted to idols. They demanded, &ldquo;O Moses! Make for us a god like their gods.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Indeed, you are a people acting ignorantly!</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">What they follow is certainly doomed to destruction and their deeds are in vain.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He added, &ldquo;Shall I seek for you a god other than Allah, while He has honoured you above the others?&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And &#761;remember&#762; when We rescued you from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with dreadful torment&mdash;killing your sons and keeping your women. That was a severe test from your Lord.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">We appointed for Moses thirty nights then added another ten&mdash;completing his Lord&rsquo;s term of forty nights. Moses commanded his brother Aaron, &ldquo;Take my place among my people, do what is right, and do not follow the way of the corruptors.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">When Moses came at the appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he asked, &ldquo;My Lord! Reveal Yourself to me so I may see You.&rdquo; Allah answered, &ldquo;You cannot see Me! But look at the mountain. If it remains firm in its place, only then will you see Me.&rdquo; When his Lord appeared to the mountain, He levelled it to dust and Moses collapsed unconscious. When he recovered, he cried, &ldquo;Glory be to You! I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Allah said, &ldquo;O Moses! I have &#761;already&#762; elevated you above all others by My messages and speech.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt303" id="ftnt_ref303">[303]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;So hold firmly to what I have given you and be grateful.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">We wrote for him on the Tablets &#761;the fundamentals&#762; of everything; commandments and explanations of all things. &#761;We commanded,&#762; &ldquo;Hold to this firmly and ask your people to take the best of it.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt304" id="ftnt_ref304">[304]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;I will soon show &#761;all of&#762; you the home of the rebellious.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt305" id="ftnt_ref305">[305]</a></sup></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">I will turn away from My signs those who act unjustly with arrogance in the land. And even if they were to see every sign, they still would not believe in them. If they see the Right Path, they will not take it. But if they see a crooked path, they will follow it. This is because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">The deeds of those who deny Our signs and the meeting &#761;with Allah&#762; in the Hereafter will be in vain. Will they be rewarded except for what they have done?&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">In the absence of Moses, his people made from their &#761;golden&#762; jewellery an idol of a calf that made a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to the &#761;Right&#762; Path? Still they took it as a god and were wrongdoers.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Later, when they were filled with remorse and realized they had gone astray, they cried, &ldquo;If our Lord does not have mercy on us and forgive us, we will certainly be losers.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Upon Moses&rsquo; return to his people, &#761;totally&#762; furious and sorrowful, he said, &ldquo;What an evil thing you committed in my absence! Did you want to hasten your Lord&rsquo;s torment?&rdquo; Then he threw down the Tablets and grabbed his brother by the hair, dragging him closer. Aaron pleaded, &ldquo;O son of my mother! The people overpowered me and were about to kill me. So do not &#761;humiliate me and&#762; make my enemies rejoice, nor count me among the wrongdoing people.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Moses prayed, &ldquo;My Lord! Forgive me and my brother! And admit us into Your mercy. You are the Most Merciful of the merciful.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Those who worshipped the calf will certainly be afflicted with Allah&rsquo;s wrath as well as disgrace in the life of this world. This is how We reward those who invent falsehood.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">But those who commit evil, then repent and become &#761;true&#762; believers, your Lord will certainly be All-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">When Moses&rsquo; anger subsided, he took up the Tablets whose text contained guidance and mercy for those who stand in awe of their Lord.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Moses chose seventy men from among his people for Our appointment and, when they were seized by an earthquake,</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt306" id="ftnt_ref306">[306]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;he cried, &ldquo;My Lord! Had You willed, You could have destroyed them long ago, and me as well. Will You destroy us for what the foolish among us have done? This is only a test from You&mdash;by which You allow whoever you will to stray and guide whoever You will. You are our Guardian. So forgive us and have mercy on us. You are the best forgiver.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Ordain for us what is good in this life and the next. Indeed, we have turned to You &#761;in repentance&#762;.&rdquo; Allah replied, &ldquo;I will inflict My torment on whoever I will. But My mercy encompasses everything. I will ordain mercy for those who shun evil, pay alms-tax, and believe in Our revelations.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&#761;They are&#762; the ones who follow the Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whose description they find in their Torah and the Gospel.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt307" id="ftnt_ref307">[307]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;He commands them to do good and forbids them from evil, permits for them what is lawful and forbids to them what is impure, and relieves them from their burdens and the shackles that bound them. &#761;Only&#762; those who believe in him, honour and support him, and follow the light sent down to him will be successful.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; &ldquo;O humanity! I am Allah&rsquo;s Messenger to you all. To Him &#761;alone&#762; belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. There is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Him. He gives life and causes death.&rdquo; So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, who believes in Allah and His revelations. And follow him, so you may be &#761;rightly&#762; guided.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">There are some among the people of Moses who guide with the truth and establish justice accordingly.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">We divided them into twelve tribes&mdash;each as a community. And We revealed to Moses, when his people asked for water, &ldquo;Strike the rock with your staff.&rdquo; Then twelve springs gushed out. Each tribe knew its drinking place. We shaded them with clouds and sent down to them manna and quails,</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt308" id="ftnt_ref308">[308]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;&#761;saying&#762;, &ldquo;Eat from the good things We have provided for you.&rdquo; They &#761;certainly&#762; did not wrong Us, but wronged themselves.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And &#761;remember&#762; when it was said to them, &ldquo;Enter this city &#761;of Jerusalem&#762; and eat from wherever you please. Say, &lsquo;Absolve us,&rsquo; and enter the gate with humility. We will forgive your sins, &#761;and&#762; We will multiply the reward for the good-doers.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">But the wrongdoers among them changed the words they were commanded to say. So We sent down a punishment from the heavens upon them for their wrongdoing.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Ask them &#761;O Prophet&#762; about &#761;the people of&#762; the town which was by the sea, who broke the Sabbath.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt309" id="ftnt_ref309">[309]</a></sup><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">During the Sabbath, &#761;abundant&#762; fish would come to them clearly visible, but on other days the fish were never seen.

Was a covenant not taken from them in the Scripture that they would not say anything about Allah except the truth? And they were already well-versed in its teachings.

Whatever you spend in the cause of Allah will be paid to you in full and you will not be wronged.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">If the enemy is inclined towards peace, make peace with them.

They fight in the cause of Allah and kill or are killed. This is a true promise binding on Him in the Torah, the Gospel, and the Quran. And whose promise is truer than Allah&rsquo;s? So rejoice in the exchange you have made with Him.

And give good news to the believers.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">It is not &#761;proper&#762; for the Prophet and the believers to seek forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were close relatives, after it has become clear to the believers that they are bound for the Hellfire.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">As for Abraham&rsquo;s prayer for his father&rsquo;s forgiveness, it was only in fulfilment of a promise he had made to him.

He then accepted their repentance. Surely He is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to them.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And &#761;Allah has also turned in mercy to&#762; the three who had remained behind, &#761;whose guilt distressed them&#762; until the earth, despite its vastness, seemed to close in on them, and their souls were torn in anguish. They knew there was no refuge from Allah except in Him. Then He turned to them in mercy so that they might repent. Surely Allah &#761;alone&#762; is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">O &nbsp;believers! Be mindful of Allah and be with the truthful.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">It was not &#761;proper&#762; for the people of Medina and the nomadic Arabs around them to avoid marching with the Messenger of Allah or to prefer their own lives above his. That is because whenever they suffer from thirst, fatigue, or hunger in the cause of Allah; or tread on a territory, unnerving the disbelievers; or inflict any loss on an enemy&mdash;it is written to their credit as a good deed. Surely Allah never discounts the reward of the good-doers.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And whenever they make a donation, small or large, or cross a valley &#761;in Allah&rsquo;s cause&#762;&mdash;it is written to their credit, so that Allah may grant them the best reward for what they used to do.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">&#761;However,&#762; it is not necessary for the believers to march forth all at once. Only a party from each group should march forth, leaving the rest to gain religious knowledge then enlighten their people when they return to them, so that they &#761;too&#762; may beware &#761;of evil&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">O believers!

These are the verses of the Book, rich in wisdom.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Is it astonishing to people that We have sent revelation to a man from among themselves, &#761;instructing him,&#762; &ldquo;Warn humanity and give good news to the believers that they will have an honourable status with their Lord.&rdquo;? Yet the disbelievers said, &ldquo;Indeed, this &#761;man&#762; is clearly a magician!&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Surely your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days,</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt363" id="ftnt_ref363">[363]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;then established Himself on the Throne, conducting every affair.

Will you not then be mindful?</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">To Him is your return all together. Allah&rsquo;s promise is &#761;always&#762; true. Indeed, He originates the creation then resurrects it so that He may justly reward those who believe and do good. But those who disbelieve will have a boiling drink and a painful punishment for their disbelief.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He is the One Who made the sun a radiant source and the moon a reflected light, with precisely ordained phases, so that you may know the number of years and calculation &#761;of time&#762;. Allah did not create all this except for a purpose. He makes the signs clear for people of knowledge.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Surely in the alternation of the day and the night, and in all that Allah has created in the heavens and the earth, there are truly signs for those mindful &#761;of Him&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Indeed, those who do not expect to meet Us, being pleased and content with this worldly life, and who are heedless of Our signs,</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">they will have the Fire as a home because of what they have committed.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Surely those who believe and do good, their Lord will guide them &#761;to Paradise&#762; through their faith, rivers will flow under their feet in the Gardens of Bliss,</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">in which their prayer will be, &ldquo;Glory be to You, O &nbsp;Allah!&rdquo; and their greeting will be, &ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; and their closing prayer will be, &ldquo;All praise is for Allah&mdash;Lord of all worlds!&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">If Allah were to hasten evil for people</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt364" id="ftnt_ref364">[364]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;as they wish to hasten good, they would have certainly been doomed. But We leave those who do not expect to meet Us to wander blindly in their defiance.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Whenever someone is touched by hardship, they cry out to Us, whether lying on their side, sitting, or standing. But when We relieve their hardship, they return to their old ways as if they had never cried to Us to remove any hardship! This is how the misdeeds of the transgressors have been made appealing to them.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">We surely destroyed &#761;other&#762; peoples before you when they did wrong, and their messengers came to them with clear proofs but they would not believe! This is how We reward the wicked people.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Then We made you their successors in the land to see how you would act.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">When Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who do not expect to meet Us say &#761;to the Prophet&#762;, &ldquo;Bring us a different Quran or make some changes in it.&rdquo; Say &#761;to them&#762;, &ldquo;It is not for me to change it on my own. I only follow what is revealed to me.

Surely He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And so it occurred to those in charge, despite seeing all the proofs &#761;of his innocence&#762;, that he should be imprisoned for a while.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt422" id="ftnt_ref422">[422]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And two other servants went to jail with Joseph. One of them said, &ldquo;I dreamt I was pressing wine.&rdquo; The other said, &ldquo;I dreamt I was carrying &#761;some&#762; bread on my head, from which birds were eating.&rdquo; &#761;Then both said,&#762; &ldquo;Tell us their interpretation, for we surely see you as one of the good-doers.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Joseph replied, &ldquo;I can even tell you what kind of meal you will be served before you receive it. This &#761;knowledge&#762; is from what my Lord has taught me. I have shunned the faith of a people who disbelieve in Allah and deny the Hereafter.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">I follow the faith of my fathers: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is not &#761;right&#762; for us to associate anything with Allah &#761;in worship&#762;. This is part of Allah&rsquo;s grace upon us and humanity, but most people are not grateful.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">O &nbsp;my fellow-prisoners! Which is far better: many different lords or Allah&mdash;the One, the Supreme?</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Whatever &#761;idols&#762; you worship instead of Him are mere names which you and your forefathers have made up</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt423" id="ftnt_ref423">[423]</a></sup><span class="c0">&mdash;a practice Allah has never authorized. It is only Allah Who decides. He has commanded that you worship none but Him. That is the upright faith, but most people do not know.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;O my fellow-prisoners! &#761;The first&#762; one of you will serve wine to his master, and the other will be crucified and the birds will eat from his head. The matter about which you inquired has been decided.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Then he said to the one he knew would survive, &ldquo;Mention me in the presence of your master.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt424" id="ftnt_ref424">[424]</a></sup><span class="c0">&rdquo; But Satan made him forget to mention Joseph to his master, so he remained in prison for several years.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And &#761;one day&#762; the King</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt425" id="ftnt_ref425">[425]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;said, &ldquo;I dreamt of seven fat cows eaten up by seven skinny ones; and seven green ears of grain and &#761;seven&#762; others dry. O &nbsp;chiefs! Tell me the meaning of my dream if you can interpret dreams.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They replied, &ldquo;These are confused visions and we do not know the interpretation of such dreams.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">&#761;Finally,&#762; the surviving ex-prisoner remembered &#761;Joseph&#762; after a long time and said, &ldquo;I will tell you its interpretation, so send me forth &#761;to Joseph&#762;.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">&#761;He said,&#762; &ldquo;Joseph, O &nbsp;man of truth! Interpret for us &#761;the dream of&#762; seven fat cows eaten up by seven skinny ones; and seven green ears of grain and &#761;seven&#762; others dry, so that I may return to the people and let them know.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Joseph replied, &ldquo;You will plant &#761;grain&#762; for seven consecutive years, leaving in the ear whatever you will harvest, except for the little you will eat.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Then after that will come seven years of great hardship which will consume whatever you have saved, except the little you will store &#761;for seed&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Then after that will come a year in which people will receive abundant rain and they will press &#761;oil and wine&#762;.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">The King &#761;then&#762; said, &ldquo;Bring him to me.&rdquo; When the messenger came to him, Joseph said, &ldquo;Go back to your master and ask him about the case of the women who cut their hands. Surely my Lord has &#761;full&#762; knowledge of their cunning.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">The King asked &#761;the women&#762;, &ldquo;What did you get when you tried to seduce Joseph?&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;Allah forbid! We know nothing indecent about him.&rdquo; Then the Chief Minister&rsquo;s wife admitted, &ldquo;Now the truth has come to light. It was I who tried to seduce him, and he is surely truthful.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">From this, Joseph should know that I did not speak dishonestly about him in his absence, for Allah certainly does not guide the scheming of the dishonest.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And I do not seek to free myself from blame, for indeed the soul is ever inclined to evil, except those shown mercy by my Lord. Surely my Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">The King said, &ldquo;Bring him to me. I will employ him exclusively in my service.&rdquo; And when Joseph spoke to him, the King said, &ldquo;Today you are highly esteemed and fully trusted by us.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Joseph proposed, &ldquo;Put me in charge of the store-houses of the land, for I am truly reliable and adept.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">This is how We established Joseph in the land to settle wherever he pleased. We shower Our mercy on whoever We will, and We never discount the reward of the good-doers.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And the reward of the Hereafter is far better for those who are faithful and are mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And Joseph&rsquo;s brothers came and entered his presence. He recognized them but they were unaware of who he really was.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">When he had provided them with their supplies, he demanded, &ldquo;Bring me your brother on your father&rsquo;s side.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt426" id="ftnt_ref426">[426]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Do you not see that I give full measure and I am the best of hosts?</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">But if you do not bring him to me &#761;next time&#762;, I will have no grain for you, nor will you ever come close to me again.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They promised, &ldquo;We will try to convince his father to let him come. We will certainly do &#761;our best&#762;.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Joseph ordered his servants to put his brothers&rsquo; money back into their saddlebags so that they would find it when they returned to their family and perhaps they would come back.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">When Joseph&rsquo;s brothers returned to their father, they pleaded, &ldquo;O our father! We have been denied &#761;further&#762; supplies. So send our brother with us so that we may receive our measure, and we will definitely watch over him.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He responded, &ldquo;Should I trust you with him as I once trusted you with his brother &#761;Joseph&#762;? But &#761;only&#762; Allah is the best Protector, and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">When they opened their bags, they discovered that their money had been returned to them. They argued, &ldquo;O our father! What more can we ask for? Here is our money, fully returned to us. Now we can buy more food for our family. We will watch over our brother, and obtain an extra camel-load of grain. That load can be easily secured.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Jacob insisted, &ldquo;I will not send him with you until you give me a solemn oath by Allah that you will certainly bring him back to me, unless you are totally overpowered.&rdquo; Then after they had given him their oaths, he concluded, &ldquo;Allah is a Witness to what we have said.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He then instructed &#761;them&#762;, &ldquo;O my sons! Do not enter &#761;the city&#762; all through one gate, but through separate gates.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt427" id="ftnt_ref427">[427]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;I cannot help you against &#761;what is destined by&#762; Allah in the least. It is only Allah Who decides. In Him I put my trust. And in Him let the faithful put their trust.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Then when they entered as their father had instructed them, this did not help them against &#761;the Will of&#762; Allah whatsoever. It was just a desire in Jacob&rsquo;s heart which he satisfied. He was truly blessed with &#761;great&#762; knowledge because of what We had taught him, but most people have no knowledge.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">When they entered Joseph&rsquo;s presence, he called his brother &#761;Benjamin&#762; aside, and confided &#761;to him&#762;, &ldquo;I am indeed your brother &#761;Joseph&#762;! So do not feel distressed about what they have been doing.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">When Joseph had provided them with supplies, he slipped the royal cup into his brother&rsquo;s bag. Then a herald cried, &ldquo;O people of the caravan! You must be thieves!&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They asked, turning back, &ldquo;What have you lost?&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">The herald &#761;along with the guards&#762; replied, &ldquo;We have lost the King&rsquo;s measuring cup. And whoever brings it will be awarded a camel-load &#761;of grain&#762;. I guarantee it.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Joseph&rsquo;s brothers replied, &ldquo;By Allah! You know well that we did not come to cause trouble in the land, nor are we thieves.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Joseph&rsquo;s men asked, &ldquo;What should be the price for theft, if you are lying?&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Joseph&rsquo;s brothers responded, &ldquo;The price will be &#761;the enslavement of&#762; the one in whose bag the cup is found. That is how we punish the wrongdoers.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Joseph began searching their bags before that of his brother &#761;Benjamin&#762;, then brought it out of Benjamin&rsquo;s bag. This is how We inspired Joseph to plan. He could not have taken his brother under the King&rsquo;s law, but Allah had so willed. We elevate in rank whoever We will. But above those ranking in knowledge is the One All-Knowing.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">&#761;To distance themselves,&#762; Joseph&rsquo;s brothers argued, &ldquo;If he has stolen, so did his &#761;full&#762; brother before.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt428" id="ftnt_ref428">[428]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;But Joseph suppressed his outrage&mdash;revealing nothing to them&mdash;and said &#761;to himself&#762;, &ldquo;You are in such an evil position,</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt429" id="ftnt_ref429">[429]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and Allah knows best &#761;the truth of&#762; what you claim.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They appealed, &ldquo;O Chief Minister! He has a very old father, so take one of us instead. We surely see you as one of the good-doers.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Joseph responded, &ldquo;Allah forbid that we should take other than the one with whom we found our property. Otherwise, we would surely be unjust.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">When they lost all hope in him, they spoke privately. The eldest of them said, &ldquo;Do you not know that your father had taken a solemn oath by Allah from you, nor how you failed him regarding Joseph before? So I am not leaving this land until my father allows me to, or Allah decides for me. For He is the Best of Judges.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Return to your father and say, &lsquo;O our father! Your son committed theft. We testify only to what we know. We could not guard against the unforeseen.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt430" id="ftnt_ref430">[430]</a></sup></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Ask &#761;the people of&#762; the land where we were and the caravan we travelled with. We are certainly telling the truth.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He cried, &ldquo;No! Your souls must have tempted you to do something &#761;evil&#762;. So &#761;I am left with nothing but&#762; beautiful patience!</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt431" id="ftnt_ref431">[431]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;I trust Allah will return them all to me. Surely He &#761;alone&#762; is the All-Knowing, All-Wise.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He turned away from them, lamenting, &ldquo;Alas, poor Joseph!&rdquo; And his eyes turned white out of the grief he suppressed.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt432" id="ftnt_ref432">[432]</a></sup></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They said, &ldquo;By Allah! You will not cease to remember Joseph until you lose your health or &#761;even&#762; your life.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He replied, &ldquo;I complain of my anguish and sorrow only to Allah, and I know from Allah what you do not know.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">O &nbsp;my sons! Go and search &#761;diligently&#762; for Joseph and his brother. And do not lose hope in the mercy of Allah, for no one loses hope in Allah&rsquo;s mercy except those with no faith.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">When they entered Joseph&rsquo;s presence, they pleaded, &ldquo;O Chief Minister! We and our family have been touched with hardship, and we have brought only a few worthless coins, but &#761;please&#762; give us our supplies in full and be charitable to us. Indeed, Allah rewards the charitable.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He asked, &ldquo;Do you remember what you did to Joseph and his brother in your ignorance?&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They replied &#761;in shock&#762;, &ldquo;Are you really Joseph?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am Joseph, and here is my brother &#761;Benjamin&#762;! Allah has truly been gracious to us. Surely whoever is mindful &#761;of Allah&#762; and patient, then certainly Allah never discounts the reward of the good-doers.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They admitted, &ldquo;By Allah! Allah has truly preferred you over us, and we have surely been sinful.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Joseph said, &ldquo;There is no blame on you today. May Allah forgive you! He is the Most Merciful of the merciful!</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Go with this shirt of mine and cast it over my father&rsquo;s face, and he will regain his sight. Then come back to me with your whole family.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">When the caravan departed &#761;from Egypt&#762;, their father said &#761;to those around him&#762;, &ldquo;You may think I am senile, but I certainly sense the smell of Joseph.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They replied, &ldquo;By Allah! You are definitely still in your old delusion.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">But when the bearer of the good news arrived, he cast the shirt over Jacob&rsquo;s face, so he regained his sight. Jacob then said &#761;to his children&#762;, &ldquo;Did I not tell you that I truly know from Allah what you do not know?&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They begged, &ldquo;O our father! Pray for the forgiveness of our sins. We have certainly been sinful.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He said, &ldquo;I will pray to my Lord for your forgiveness.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt433" id="ftnt_ref433">[433]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;He &#761;alone&#762; is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">When they entered Joseph&rsquo;s presence, he received his parents &#761;graciously&#762; and said, &ldquo;Enter Egypt, Allah willing, in security.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Then he raised his parents to the throne, and they all fell down in prostration to Joseph,</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt434" id="ftnt_ref434">[434]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;who then said, &ldquo;O my dear father! This is the interpretation of my old dream. My Lord has made it come true.

Surely He &#761;alone&#762; is the All-Knowing, All-Wise.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My Lord! You have surely granted me authority and taught me the interpretation of dreams. &#761;O&#762; Originator of the heavens and the earth! You are my Guardian in this world and the Hereafter.

It is only a reminder to the whole world.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">How many signs in the heavens and the earth do they pass by with indifference!</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And most of them do not believe in Allah without associating others with Him &#761;in worship&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Do they feel secure that an overwhelming torment from Allah will not overtake them, or that the Hour will not take them by surprise when they least expect &#761;it&#762;?</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; &ldquo;This is my way. I invite to Allah with insight&mdash;I and those who follow me. Glory be to Allah, and I am not one of the polytheists.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">We only sent before you &#761;O Prophet&#762; men inspired by Us from among the people of each society. Have the deniers not travelled through the land to see what was the end of those &#761;destroyed&#762; before them? And surely the &#761;eternal&#762; Home of the Hereafter is far better for those mindful &#761;of Allah&#762;. Will you not then understand?</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And when the messengers despaired and their people thought the messengers had been denied help, Our help came to them &#761;at last&#762;. We then saved whoever We willed, and Our punishment is never averted from the wicked people.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">In their stories there is truly a lesson for people of reason. This message cannot be a fabrication, rather &#761;it is&#762; a confirmation of previous revelation, a detailed explanation of all things, a guide, and a mercy for people of faith.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c11">Alif-L&atilde;m-M&#297;m-Ra</span><span class="c0">. These are the verses of the Book. What has been revealed to you &#761;O Prophet&#762; from your Lord is the truth, but most people do not believe.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">It is Allah Who has raised the heavens without pillars&mdash;as you can see&mdash;then established Himself on the Throne. He has subjected the sun and the moon, each orbiting for an appointed term. He conducts the whole affair. He makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And He is the One Who spread out the earth and placed firm mountains and rivers upon it, and created fruits of every kind in pairs.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt438" id="ftnt_ref438">[438]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;He covers the day with night. Surely in this are signs for those who reflect.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And on the earth there are &#761;different&#762; neighbouring tracts, gardens of grapevines, &#761;various&#762; crops, palm trees&mdash;some stemming from the same root, others standing alone. They are all irrigated with the same water, yet We make some taste better than others. Surely in this are signs for those who understand.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">&#761;Now,&#762; if anything should amaze you &#761;O Prophet&#762;, then it is their question: &ldquo;When we are reduced to dust, will we really be raised as a new creation?&rdquo; It is they who have disbelieved in their Lord. It is they who will have shackles around their necks. And it is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They ask you &#761;O Prophet&#762; to hasten the torment rather than grace, though there have &#761;already&#762; been &#761;many&#762; torments before them. Surely your Lord is full of forgiveness for people, despite their wrongdoing, and your Lord is truly severe in punishment.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">The disbelievers say, &ldquo;If only a sign could be sent down to him from his Lord.&rdquo; You &#761;O Prophet&#762; are only a warner.

Indeed, Allah would never change a people&rsquo;s state &#761;of favour&#762; until they change their own state &#761;of faith&#762;. And if it is Allah&rsquo;s Will to torment a people, it can never be averted, nor can they find a protector other than Him.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He is the One Who shows you lightning, inspiring &#761;you with&#762; hope and fear,</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt440" id="ftnt_ref440">[440]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and produces heavy clouds.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">The thunder glorifies His praises, as do the angels in awe of Him.

But those &#761;idols&#762; the pagans invoke besides Him &#761;can&#762; never respond to them in any way. &#761;It is&#762; just like someone who stretches out their hands to water, &#761;asking it&#762; to reach their mouths, but it can never do so. The calls of the disbelievers are only in vain.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">To Allah &#761;alone&#762; bow down &#761;in submission&#762;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt441" id="ftnt_ref441">[441]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;all those in the heavens and the earth&mdash;willingly or unwillingly&mdash;as do their shadows, morning and evening.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Ask &#761;them, O &nbsp;Prophet&#762;, &ldquo;Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?&rdquo; Say, &ldquo;Allah!&rdquo; Ask &#761;them&#762;, &ldquo;Why &#761;then&#762; have you taken besides Him lords who cannot even benefit or protect themselves?&rdquo; Say, &ldquo;Can the blind and the sighted be equal?

Say, &ldquo;Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Supreme.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He sends down rain from the sky, causing the valleys to flow, each according to its capacity. The currents then carry along rising foam, similar to the slag produced from metal that people melt in the fire for ornaments or tools. This is how Allah compares truth to falsehood. The &#761;worthless&#762; residue is then cast away, but what benefits people remains on the earth. This is how Allah sets forth parables.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Those who respond to &#761;the call of&#762; their Lord will have the finest reward. As for those who do not respond to Him, even if they were to possess everything in the world twice over, they would certainly offer it to ransom themselves.

And We will make them &#761;all&#762; share in the same doom.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">The wicked will see the Fire and realize that they are bound to fall into it, and will find no way to avoid it.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">We have surely set forth in this Quran every &#761;kind of&#762; lesson for people, but humankind is the most argumentative of all beings.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And nothing prevents people from believing when guidance comes to them and from seeking their Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness except &#761;their demand&#762; to meet the same fate of earlier deniers or that the torment would confront them face to face.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">We do not send the messengers except as deliverers of good news and warners. But the disbelievers argue in falsehood, &#761;hoping&#762; to discredit the truth with it, and make a mockery of My revelations and warnings.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And who does more wrong than those who, when reminded of their Lord&rsquo;s revelations, turn away from them and forget what their own hands have done? We have certainly cast veils over their hearts&mdash;leaving them unable to comprehend this &#761;Quran&#762;&mdash;and deafness in their ears. And if you &#761;O Prophet&#762; invite them to &#761;true&#762; guidance, they will never be &#761;rightly&#762; guided.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Your Lord is the All-Forgiving, Full of Mercy. If He were to seize them &#761;immediately&#762; for what they commit, He would have certainly hastened their punishment. But they have an appointed time, from which they will find no refuge.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Those &#761;are the&#762; societies We destroyed when they persisted in wrong,</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt529" id="ftnt_ref529">[529]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and We had set a time for their destruction.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And &#761;remember&#762; when Moses said to his young assistant, &ldquo;I will never give up until I reach the junction of the two seas, even if I travel for ages.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt530" id="ftnt_ref530">[530]</a></sup></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">But when they &#761;finally&#762; reached the point where the seas met, they forgot their &#761;salted&#762; fish, and it made its way into the sea, slipping away &#761;wondrously&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">When they had passed further, he said to his assistant, &ldquo;Bring us our meal! We have certainly been exhausted by today&rsquo;s journey.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He replied, &ldquo;Do you remember when we rested by the rock? &#761;That is when&#762; I forgot the fish. None made me forget to mention this except Satan. And the fish made its way into the sea miraculously.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt531" id="ftnt_ref531">[531]</a></sup></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Moses responded, &ldquo;That is &#761;exactly&#762; what we were looking for.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt532" id="ftnt_ref532">[532]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;So they returned, retracing their footsteps.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">There they found a servant of Ours, to whom We had granted mercy from Us and enlightened with knowledge of Our Own.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Moses said to him, &ldquo;May I follow you, provided that you teach me some of the right guidance you have been taught?&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He said, &ldquo;You certainly cannot be patient &#761;enough&#762; with me.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And how can you be patient with what is beyond your &#761;realm of&#762; knowledge?&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Moses assured &#761;him&#762;, &ldquo;You will find me patient, Allah willing, and I will not disobey any of your orders.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He responded, &ldquo;Then if you follow me, do not question me about anything until I &#761;myself&#762; clarify it for you.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So they set out, but after they had boarded a ship, the man made a hole in it. Moses protested, &ldquo;Have you done this to drown its people? You have certainly done a terrible thing!&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He replied, &ldquo;Did I not say that you cannot have patience with me?&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Moses pleaded, &ldquo;Excuse me for forgetting, and do not be hard on me.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So they proceeded until they came across a boy, and the man killed him. Moses protested, &ldquo;Have you killed an innocent soul, who killed no one? You have certainly done a horrible thing.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He answered, &ldquo;Did I not tell you that you cannot have patience with me?&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Moses replied, &ldquo;If I ever question you about anything after this, then do not keep me in your company, for by then I would have given you enough of an excuse.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So they moved on until they came to the people of a town. They asked them for food, but the people refused to give them hospitality. There they found a wall ready to collapse, so the man set it right. Moses protested, &ldquo;If you wanted, you could have demanded a fee for this.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He replied, &ldquo;This is the parting of our ways. I will explain to you what you could not bear patiently.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As for the ship, it belonged to some poor people, working at sea. So I intended to damage it, for there was a &#761;tyrant&#762; king ahead of them who seizes every &#761;good&#762; ship by force.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;And as for the boy, his parents were &#761;true&#762; believers, and we</span><sup class="c4"><a href="#ftnt533" id="ftnt_ref533">[533]</a></sup><span class="c6">&nbsp;feared that he would pressure them into defiance and disbelief.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c6">So we hoped that their Lord would give them another, more virtuous and caring in his place.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and under the wall was a treasure that belonged to them, and their father had been a righteous man. So your Lord willed that these children should come of age and retrieve their treasure, as a mercy from your Lord. I did not do it &#761;all&#762; on my own. This is the explanation of what you could not bear patiently.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt534" id="ftnt_ref534">[534]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They ask you &#761;O Prophet&#762; about &#11371;ul-Qarnain.

We said, &ldquo;O &#11371;ul-Qarnain! Either punish them or treat them kindly.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He responded, &ldquo;Whoever does wrong will be punished by us, then will be returned to their Lord, Who will punish them with a horrible torment.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">As for those who believe and do good, they will have the finest reward, and we will assign them easy commands.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Then he travelled a &#761;different&#762; course</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">until he reached the rising &#761;point&#762; of the sun.

He was truly one of the corruptors.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">But it was Our Will to favour those who were oppressed in the land, making them models &#761;of faith&#762; as well as successors;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">and to establish them in the land; and through them show Pharaoh, Ham&acirc;n,</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt752" id="ftnt_ref752">[752]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and their soldiers &#761;the fulfilment of&#762; what they feared.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt753" id="ftnt_ref753">[753]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">We inspired the mother of Moses: &ldquo;Nurse him, but when you fear for him, put him then into the river, and do not fear or grieve. We will certainly return him to you, and make him one of the messengers.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And &#761;it so happened that&#762; Pharaoh&rsquo;s people picked him up, only to become their enemy and source of grief. Surely Pharaoh, Ham&acirc;n, and their soldiers were sinful.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Pharaoh&rsquo;s wife said &#761;to him&#762;, &ldquo;&#761;This baby is&#762; a source of joy for me and you. Do not kill him. Perhaps he may be useful to us or we may adopt him as a son.&rdquo; They were unaware &#761;of what was to come&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And the heart of Moses&rsquo; mother ached so much that she almost gave away his identity, had We not reassured her heart in order for her to have faith &#761;in Allah&rsquo;s promise&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And she said to his sister, &ldquo;Keep track of him!&rdquo; So she watched him from a distance, while they were unaware.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And We had caused him to refuse all wet-nurses at first, so his sister suggested, &ldquo;Shall I direct you to a family who will bring him up for you and take good care of him?&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">This is how We returned him to his mother so that her heart would be put at ease, and not grieve, and that she would know that Allah&rsquo;s promise is &#761;always&#762; true. But most people do not know.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And when he reached full strength and maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. This is how We reward the good-doers.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">&#761;One day&#762; he entered the city unnoticed by its people.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt754" id="ftnt_ref754">[754]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;There he found two men fighting: one of his own people, and the other of his enemies. The man from his people called to him for help against his foe. So Moses punched him, causing his death. Moses cried, &ldquo;This is from Satan&rsquo;s handiwork. He is certainly a sworn, misleading enemy.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He pleaded, &ldquo;My Lord! I have definitely wronged my soul, so forgive me.&rdquo; So He forgave him, &#761;for&#762; He is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Moses pledged, &ldquo;My Lord! For all Your favours upon me, I will never side with the wicked.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And so Moses became fearful, watching out in the city, when suddenly the one who sought his help the day before cried out to him again for help. Moses rebuked him, &ldquo;Indeed, you are clearly a trouble-maker.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Then when Moses was about to lay his hands on their foe,</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt755" id="ftnt_ref755">[755]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;the enemy said, &ldquo;O Moses! Do you intend to kill me as you killed a man yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land. You do not intend to make peace!&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And there came a man, rushing from the farthest end of the city. He said, &ldquo;O Moses! The chiefs are actually conspiring against you to put you to death, so leave &#761;the city&#762;. I really advise you &#761;to do so&#762;.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So Moses left the city in a state of fear and caution, praying, &ldquo;My Lord! Deliver me from the wrongdoing people.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And as he made his way towards Midian, he said, &ldquo;I trust my Lord will guide me to the right way.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">When he arrived at the well of Midian, he found a group of people watering &#761;their herds&#762;. Apart from them, he noticed two women holding back &#761;their herd&#762;. He asked &#761;them&#762;, &ldquo;What is the problem?&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;We cannot water &#761;our animals&#762; until the &#761;other&#762; shepherds are done, for our father is a very old man.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So he watered &#761;their herd&#762; for them, then withdrew to the shade and prayed, &ldquo;My Lord! I am truly in &#761;desperate&#762; need of whatever provision You may have in store for me.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt756" id="ftnt_ref756">[756]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Then one of the two women came to him, walking bashfully. She said, &ldquo;My father is inviting you so he may reward you for watering &#761;our animals&#762; for us.&rdquo; When Moses came to him and told him his whole story, the old man said, &ldquo;Have no fear! You are &#761;now&#762; safe from the wrongdoing people.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">One of the two daughters suggested, &ldquo;O my dear father! Hire him. The best man for employment is definitely the strong and trustworthy &#761;one&#762;.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">The old man proposed, &ldquo;I wish to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you, provided that you stay in my service for eight years. If you complete ten, it will be &#761;a favour&#762; from you, but I do not wish to make it difficult for you. Allah willing, you will find me an agreeable man.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Moses responded, &ldquo;&#761;Then&#762; it is &#761;settled&#762; between you and I. Whichever term I fulfill, there will be no &#761;further&#762; obligation on me. And Allah is a Witness to what we say.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">When Moses had completed the term and was travelling with his family, he spotted a fire on the side of Mount &#7788;&ucirc;r. He said to his family, &ldquo;Stay here, &#761;for&#762; I have spotted a fire. Perhaps from there I can bring you some directions</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt757" id="ftnt_ref757">[757]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;or a torch from the fire so you may warm yourselves.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">But when he came to it, he was called from the bush in the sacred ground to the right side of the valley: &ldquo;O Moses! It is truly I. I am Allah&mdash;the Lord of all worlds.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Now, throw down your staff!&rdquo; But when he saw it slithering like a snake, he ran away without looking back. &#761;Allah reassured him,&#762; &ldquo;O Moses! Draw near, and have no fear. You are perfectly secure.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Now put your hand through &#761;the opening of&#762; your collar, it will come out &#761;shining&#762; white, unblemished.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt758" id="ftnt_ref758">[758]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;And cross your arms tightly to calm your fears.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt759" id="ftnt_ref759">[759]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;These are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs. They have truly been a rebellious people.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Moses appealed, &ldquo;My Lord! I have indeed killed a man from them, so I fear they may kill me.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And my brother Aaron is more eloquent than I, so send him with me as a helper to support what I say, for I truly fear they may reject me.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Allah responded, &ldquo;We will assist you with your brother and grant you both authority, so they cannot harm you. With Our signs, you and those who follow you will &#761;certainly&#762; prevail.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">But when Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they said &#761;arrogantly&#762;, &ldquo;This is nothing but conjured magic &#761;tricks&#762;. We have never heard of this in &#761;the history of&#762; our forefathers.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Moses responded, &ldquo;My Lord knows best who has come with &#761;true&#762; guidance from Him and will fare best in the end. Indeed, the wrongdoers will never succeed.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Pharaoh declared, &ldquo;O chiefs! I know of no other god for you but myself. So bake bricks out of clay for me, O &nbsp;Ham&acirc;n, and build a high tower so I may look at the God of Moses, although I am sure he is a liar.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And so he and his soldiers behaved arrogantly in the land with no right, thinking they would never be returned to Us.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So We seized him and his soldiers, casting</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">them into the sea. See then what was the end of the wrongdoers!</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">We made them leaders inviting &#761;others&#762; to the Fire. And on the Day of Judgment they will not be helped.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">We caused a curse to follow them in this world. And on the Day of Judgment they will be among the outcasts.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Indeed, We gave Moses the Scripture&mdash;after destroying earlier nations&mdash;as an insight for the people, a guide, and mercy so perhaps they would be mindful.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">You were not there &#761;O Prophet&#762; on the western side of the mountain when We entrusted the Commandments to Moses, nor were you present &#761;in his time&#762;.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt760" id="ftnt_ref760">[760]</a></sup></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">But We &#761;later&#762; raised &#761;several&#762; generations, and the ages took their toll on them.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt761" id="ftnt_ref761">[761]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Nor were you living among the people of Midian, rehearsing Our revelations with them.

But &#761;you have been sent&#762; as a mercy from your Lord to warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, so perhaps they may be mindful.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Also so they would not say, if struck by an affliction for what their hands have done: &ldquo;Our Lord! If only You had sent us a messenger, we would have followed Your revelations and become believers.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, &ldquo;If only he was given the like of what Moses had been given.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt762" id="ftnt_ref762">[762]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Did they not deny what had been given to Moses earlier?

And who could be more astray than those who follow their desires with no guidance from Allah? Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Indeed, We have steadily delivered the Word &#761;of Allah&#762; to the people so they may be mindful.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">&#761;As for&#762; those &#761;faithful&#762; to whom We had given the Scripture before this &#761;Quran&#762;, they do believe in it.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">When it is recited to them, they declare, &ldquo;We believe in it.

Peace &#761;is our only response&#762; to you! We want nothing to do with those who act ignorantly.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">You surely cannot guide whoever you like &#761;O Prophet&#762;, but it is Allah Who guides whoever He wills, and He knows best who are &#761;fit to be&#762; guided.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They say &#761;to the Prophet&#762;, &ldquo;If we were to follow &#761;true&#762; guidance with you, we would certainly be snatched away from our land.&rdquo; Have We not established for them a safe haven &#761;in Mecca&#762; to which fruits of all kinds are brought as a provision from Us? But most of them do not know &#761;this favour&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">&#761;Imagine&#762; how many societies We have destroyed that had been spoiled by their &#761;comfortable&#762; living!

These &#761;followers&#762; are the ones we caused to deviate. We led them into deviance, for we ourselves were deviant. We disassociate ourselves &#761;from them&#762; before You. It was not us that they used to worship.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">It will be said &#761;to the disbelievers&#762;, &ldquo;Call upon your associate-gods &#761;for help&#762;.&rdquo; So they will call them, but will receive no response. And they will face the punishment, wishing they had been &#761;rightly&#762; guided!</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And &#761;watch for&#762; the Day He will call to them, asking, &ldquo;What response did you give to the messengers?&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">They will be too dumbstruck on that Day to ask one another &#761;for answers&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">As for those who repent, believe, and do good &#761;in this world&#762;, it is right to hope that they will be among the successful.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Your Lord creates and chooses whatever He wills&mdash;the choice is not theirs.

There is no god &#761;worthy of worship&#762; except Him. All praise belongs to Him in this life and the next. All authority is His. And to Him you will &#761;all&#762; be returned.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Ask &#761;them, O &nbsp;Prophet&#762;, &ldquo;Imagine if Allah were to make the night perpetual for you until the Day of Judgment, which god other than Allah could bring you sunlight?

We had granted him such treasures that even their keys would burden a group of strong men. &#761;Some of&#762; his people advised him, &ldquo;Do not be prideful! Surely Allah does not like the prideful.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Rather, seek the &#761;reward&#762; of the Hereafter by means of what Allah has granted you, without forgetting your share of this world. And be good &#761;to others&#762; as Allah has been good to you. Do not seek to spread corruption in the land, for Allah certainly does not like the corruptors.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He replied, &ldquo;I have been granted all this because of some knowledge I have.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt768" id="ftnt_ref768">[768]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Did he not know that Allah had already destroyed some from the generations before him who were far superior to him in power and greater in accumulating &#761;wealth&#762;?

Allah&rsquo;s reward is far better for those who believe and do good. But none will attain this except the steadfast.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Then We caused the earth to swallow him up, along with his home. There was no one to help him against Allah, nor could he even help himself.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And those who had craved his position the previous day began to say, &ldquo;Ah! It is certainly Allah Who gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills of His servants. Had it not been for the grace of Allah, He could have surely caused the earth to swallow us up! Oh, indeed! The disbelievers will never succeed.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">That &#761;eternal&#762; Home in the Hereafter We reserve &#761;only&#762; for those who seek neither tyranny nor corruption on the earth.

How wrong is their judgment!</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Whoever hopes for the meeting with Allah, &#761;let them know that&#762; Allah&rsquo;s appointed time is sure to come. He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And whoever strives &#761;in Allah&rsquo;s cause&#762;, only does so for their own good. Surely Allah is not in need of &#761;any of&#762; His creation.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">As for those who believe and do good, We will certainly absolve them of their sins, and reward them according to the best of what they used to do.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">We have commanded people to honour their parents.

To Me you will &#761;all&#762; return, and then I will inform you of what you used to do.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Those who believe and do good will surely be admitted by Us into &#761;the company of&#762; the righteous.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">There are some who say, &ldquo;We believe in Allah,&rdquo; but when they suffer in the cause of Allah, they mistake &#761;this&#762; persecution at the hands of people for the punishment of Allah. But when victory comes from your Lord, they surely say &#761;to the believers&#762;, &ldquo;We have always been with you.&rdquo; Does Allah not know best what is in the hearts of all beings?</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Allah will certainly distinguish between those who have &#761;sure&#762; faith and the hypocrites.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">The disbelievers say to the believers, &ldquo;&#761;Just&#762; follow our way, and we will bear &#761;the burden of&#762; your sins.&rdquo; But they would never &#761;want to&#762; bear any of the believers&rsquo; sins.

Then the Flood overtook them, while they persisted in wrongdoing.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">But We delivered him and those in the Ark, making it a sign for all people.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And &#761;remember&#762; when Abraham said to his people, &ldquo;Worship Allah, and fear Him. This is better for you, if only you knew.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">You worship besides Allah nothing but idols, simply creating lies &#761;about them&#762;. Those you worship besides Allah certainly cannot give you any provision. So seek provision from Allah &#761;alone&#762;, worship Him, and be grateful to Him. To Him you will &#761;all&#762; be returned.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">If you persist in denial, so did &#761;many&#762; communities before you. The Messenger&rsquo;s duty is only to deliver &#761;the message&#762; clearly.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Have they not seen how Allah originates the creation then resurrects it? That is certainly easy for Allah.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; &ldquo;Travel throughout the land and see how He originated the creation, then Allah will bring it into being one more time. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He punishes whoever He wills, and shows mercy to whoever He wills.

Nor have you any protector or helper besides Allah.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">As for those who disbelieve in Allah&rsquo;s signs and the meeting with Him, it is they who will have no hope in His mercy.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt774" id="ftnt_ref774">[774]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;And it is they who will suffer a painful punishment.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">But the only response of Abraham&rsquo;s people was to say: &ldquo;Kill him or burn him!&rdquo; But Allah saved him from the fire.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt775" id="ftnt_ref775">[775]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Surely in this are signs for people who believe.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He said &#761;to his people&#762;, &ldquo;You have taken idols &#761;for worship&#762; instead of Allah, only to keep &#761;the bond of&#762; harmony among yourselves in this worldly life. But on the Day of Judgment you will disown and curse one another. Your home will be the Fire, and you will have no helper!&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So Lot believed in him.

And do not go about spreading corruption in the land.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">But they rejected him, so an &#761;overwhelming&#762; earthquake struck them and they fell lifeless in their homes.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And the people of &rsquo;&#514;d and Tham&ucirc;d &#761;met a similar fate&#762;, which must be clear to you &#761;Meccans&#762; from their ruins.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt778" id="ftnt_ref778">[778]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Satan made their &#761;evil&#762; deeds appealing to them, hindering them from the &#761;Right&#762; Way, although they were capable of reasoning.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">&#761;We&#762; also &#761;destroyed&#762; Korah, Pharaoh, and Ham&acirc;n. Indeed, Moses had come to them with clear proofs, but they behaved arrogantly in the land.

Allah would not have wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">The parable of those who take protectors other than Allah is that of a spider spinning a shelter.

Surely in this is a sign for the people of faith.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Recite what has been revealed to you of the Book and establish prayer. Indeed, &#761;genuine&#762; prayer should deter &#761;one&#762; from indecency and wickedness. The remembrance of Allah is &#761;an&#762; even greater &#761;deterrent&#762;.

And then to Him you will &#761;all&#762; be returned.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">On the Day the Hour will arrive, the wicked will be dumbstruck.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">There will be no intercessors for them from among their associate-gods, and they will &#761;totally&#762; deny their associate-gods.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And on the Day the Hour will arrive, the people will then be split &#761;into two groups&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">As for those who believed and did good, they will be rejoicing in a Garden.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And as for those who disbelieved, and denied Our signs and the meeting &#761;with Allah&#762; in the Hereafter, they will be confined in punishment.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So glorify Allah in the evening and in the morning&mdash;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">all praise is for Him in the heavens and the earth&mdash;as well as in the afternoon, and at noon.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt784" id="ftnt_ref784">[784]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living. And He gives life to the earth after its death. And so will you be brought forth &#761;from the grave&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">One of His signs is that He created you from dust, then&mdash;behold!&mdash;you are human beings spreading over &#761;the earth&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And one of His signs is that He created for you spouses from among yourselves so that you may find comfort in them. And He has placed between you compassion and mercy. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And one of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the diversity of your languages and colours. Surely in this are signs for those of &#761;sound&#762; knowledge.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And one of His signs is your sleep by night and by day &#761;for rest&#762; as well as your seeking His bounty &#761;in both&#762;. Surely in this are signs for people who listen.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And one of His signs is that He shows you lightning, inspiring &#761;you with&#762; hope and fear.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt785" id="ftnt_ref785">[785]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;And He sends down rain from the sky, reviving the earth after its death. Surely in this are signs for people who understand.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And one of His signs is that the heavens and the earth persist by His command. Then when He calls you out of the earth just once, you will instantly come forth.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And to Him belong all those in the heavens and the earth&mdash;all are subject to His Will.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt786" id="ftnt_ref786">[786]</a></sup></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And He is the One Who originates the creation then will resurrect it&mdash;which is even easier for Him.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt787" id="ftnt_ref787">[787]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;To Him belong the finest attributes in the heavens and the earth. And He is the Almighty, All-Wise.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He sets forth for you an example &#761;drawn&#762; from your own lives: would you allow some of those &#761;bondspeople&#762; in your possession to be your equal partners in whatever &#761;wealth&#762; We have provided you, keeping them in mind as you are mindful of your peers?</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt788" id="ftnt_ref788">[788]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is how We make the signs clear for people who understand.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">In fact, the wrongdoers merely follow their desires with no knowledge. Who then can guide those Allah has left to stray? They will have no helpers.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So be steadfast in faith in all uprightness &#761;O Prophet&#762;&mdash;the natural Way of Allah which He has instilled in &#761;all&#762; people. Let there be no change in this creation of Allah. That is the Straight Way, but most people do not know.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">&#761;O believers!&#762; Always turn to Him &#761;in repentance&#762;, be mindful of Him, and establish prayers. And do not be polytheists&mdash;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">&#761;like&#762; those who have divided their faith and split into sects, each rejoicing in what they have.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">When people are touched with hardship, they cry out to their Lord, turning to Him &#761;alone&#762;. But as soon as He gives them a taste of His mercy, a group of them associates &#761;others&#762; with their Lord &#761;in worship&#762;,</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">becoming ungrateful for whatever &#761;favours&#762; We have given them. So enjoy yourselves, for soon you will know.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Or have We sent down to them an authority which attests to what they associate &#761;with Him&#762;?</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">If We give people a taste of mercy, they become prideful &#761;because&#762; of it. But if they are afflicted with an evil for what their hands have done, they instantly fall into despair.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Have they not seen that Allah gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills? Surely in this are signs for people who believe.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So give your close relatives their due, as well as the poor and the &#761;needy&#762; traveller. That is best for those who seek the pleasure of Allah,</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt789" id="ftnt_ref789">[789]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and it is they who will be successful.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Whatever loans you give, &#761;only&#762; seeking interest at the expense of people&rsquo;s wealth</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt790" id="ftnt_ref790">[790]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;will not increase with Allah. But whatever charity you give, &#761;only&#762; seeking the pleasure of Allah&mdash;it is they whose reward will be multiplied.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">It is Allah Who created you, then gives you provisions, then will cause you to die, and then will bring you back to life. Can any of your associate-gods do any of this? Glorified and Exalted is He above what they associate with Him &#761;in worship&#762;!</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Corruption has spread on land and sea as a result of what people&rsquo;s hands have done, so that Allah may cause them to taste &#761;the consequences of&#762; some of their deeds and perhaps they might return &#761;to the Right Path&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Say, &#761;O Prophet,&#762; &ldquo;Travel throughout the land and see what was the end of those &#761;destroyed&#762; before &#761;you&#762;&mdash;most of them were polytheists.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So be steadfast in the Upright Faith &#761;O Prophet&#762;, before the coming of a Day from Allah that cannot be averted. On that Day the people will be divided:</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">those who disbelieved will bear &#761;the burden of&#762; their own disbelief; and those who did good will have prepared for themselves &#761;eternal homes&#762;,</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">so that He may &#761;generously&#762; reward those who believe and do good, out of His grace. He truly does not like the disbelievers.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And one of His signs is that He sends the winds, ushering in good news &#761;of rain&#762; so that He may give you a taste of His mercy, and that ships may sail by His command, and that you may seek His bounty, and perhaps you will be grateful.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Indeed, We sent before you &#761;O Prophet&#762; messengers, each to their own people, and they came to them with clear proofs. Then We inflicted punishment upon those who persisted in wickedness. For it is Our duty to help the believers.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">It is Allah Who sends the winds, which then stir up &#761;vapour, forming&#762; clouds, which He then spreads out in the sky or piles up into masses as He wills, from which you see rain come forth. Then as soon as He causes it to fall on whoever He wills of His servants, they rejoice,</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">although they had utterly lost hope just before it was sent down to them.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">See then the impact of Allah&rsquo;s mercy: how He gives life to the earth after its death! Surely That &#761;same God&#762; can raise the dead. For He is Most Capable of everything.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Then if We send a &#761;harsh&#762; wind which they see withering &#761;their&#762; crops, they will definitely deny &#761;old favours&#762; right after.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So you &#761;O Prophet&#762; certainly cannot make the dead hear &#761;the truth&#762;. Nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs and walk away.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Nor can you lead the blind out of their misguidance. You can make none hear &#761;the truth&#762; except those who believe in Our revelations, &#761;fully&#762; submitting &#761;to Allah&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">It is Allah Who created you in a state of weakness, then developed &#761;your&#762; weakness into strength, then developed &#761;your&#762; strength into weakness and old age.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt791" id="ftnt_ref791">[791]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;He creates whatever He wills. For He is the All-Knowing, Most Capable.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">And on the Day the Hour will arrive, the wicked will swear that they did not stay &#761;in this world&#762; more than an hour. In this way they were always deluded &#761;in the world&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">But those gifted with knowledge and faith will say &#761;to them&#762;, &ldquo;You did actually stay&mdash;as destined by Allah&mdash;until the Day of Resurrection. So here is the Day of Resurrection &#761;which you denied&#762;! But you did not know &#761;it was true&#762;.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">So on that Day the wrongdoers&rsquo; excuses will not benefit them, nor will they be allowed to appease &#761;their Lord&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c6">We have certainly set forth every &#761;kind of&#762; lesson for people in this Quran. And no matter what sign you bring to them &#761;O Prophet&#762;, the disbelievers will definitely say &#761;to the believers&#762;, &ldquo;You are only a people of falsehood.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c6">This is how Allah seals the hearts of those unwilling to know &#761;the truth&#762;.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c6">So be patient, for the promise of Allah certainly is true.

Allah&rsquo;s promise is true. And He is the Almighty, All-Wise.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">He created the heavens without pillars&mdash;as you can see&mdash;and placed firm mountains upon the earth so it does not shake with you, and scattered throughout it all types of creatures.

Now show Me what those &#761;gods&#762; other than Him have created. In fact, the wrongdoers are clearly astray.</span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">Indeed, We blessed Luqm&acirc;n with wisdom, &#761;saying&#762;, &ldquo;Be grateful to Allah, for whoever is grateful, it is only for their own good.

Still keep their company in this world courteously, and follow the way of those who turn to Me &#761;in devotion&#762;.

Verse 2:282 talks about witnessing a debt contract, not giving testimony. To fully understand the context of this verse, we need to keep in mind that 1500 years ago women did not normally participate in business transactions or travel with trading caravans and, therefore, not every woman had the expertise to witness a debt contract. Even if two women were available at the time of signing the contract, perhaps the primary witness might not be able to recall the details of the contract or appear before a judge because of compelling circumstances such as pregnancy or delivery. In any of these cases, the second woman will be a back-up. Some scholars maintain that one woman can be sufficient as a witness so long as she is reliable. As for giving testimony, a ruling can be made based on available testimony, regardless of the number or gender of the witnesses. For example, the beginning of Rama&#7693;&acirc;n is usually confirmed by the sighting of the new moon, regardless of the gender of the person who sights the moon. Also the highest form of witness in Islam is for someone to testify they heard a narration (or </span><span class="c12">&#7717;ad&icirc;th</span><span class="c8">) from the Prophet (&#65018;). An authentic </span><span class="c12">&#7717;ad&icirc;th</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;is accepted by all Muslims regardless of the gender of the narrator. Moreover, if a husband accuses his wife of adultery and he has no witnesses, each spouse must testify five times that they are telling the truth and the other side is lying. Both testimonies are equal (</span><span class="c12">see</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;24:6-10). In some cases, only women&rsquo;s testimony is accepted while men&rsquo;s testimony is rejected, such as testifying regarding a woman&rsquo;s pregnancy or virginity. </span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref117" id="ftnt117">[117]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;The Standard (</span><span class="c12">Al-Furq&acirc;n</span><span class="c8">)</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">is one of the names of the Quran. </span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref118" id="ftnt118">[118]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;The precise verses are easy to understand and deal mostly with matters of belief and practice, such as the belief in one God (</span><span class="c12">S&ucirc;rah</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;112), forbidden foods (</span><span class="c12">see</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;5:3), and the commandments in 6:151-152 and 17:23-39.

Unlike any previous faith, Islam puts a limit on the number of wives a man can have. Under certain circumstances, a Muslim man may marry up to four wives as long as he is able to provide for them and maintain justice among them&mdash;otherwise it is unlawful. With the exception of Jesus Christ and John the Baptist (neither of whom were married), almost all religious figures in the Bible had more than one wife. According to the Bible, Solomon (&#65018;) had 700 wives and 300 concubines (1 Kings 11:3) and his father, David (&#65018;), had many wives and concubines (2 Samuel 5:13). </span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref165" id="ftnt165">[165]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;A bondwoman is a female slave that a man owned either through purchase or taking her captive in war&mdash;a common ancient practice in many parts of the world. Islam opened the door for ending slavery by making it an act of charity to free slaves. Many sins (such as breaking one&rsquo;s oath, unintentional killing, and intercourse with one&rsquo;s wife during the day of fasting in Rama&#7693;&acirc;n) can be atoned by freeing a slave. According to Islamic teachings, no free person can be enslaved. Islam also improved the condition of slaves. It was unlawful to separate a mother from her child. Children born to a slave-master were deemed free, and their mother would gain her freedom upon the death of her master. With regards to slaves, Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad (&#65018;) says, &ldquo;Feed them from what you eat, clothe them from what you wear, and do not overwhelm them with work unless you assist them.&rdquo; He (&#65018;) also says, &ldquo;Whoever kills his slave will be killed and whoever injures his slave will be injured.&rdquo; In recent times, slavery has been outlawed in all countries&mdash;including the Muslim world. </span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref166" id="ftnt166">[166]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;For example, in the case of orphaned children whose grandfather then dies, leaving behind other children, some scholars rule that an obligatory bequest should be made to them despite not having a share in inheritance.</span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref167" id="ftnt167">[167]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;According to Islamic law of inheritance, a female&mdash;whether she is a mother, a wife, a sister, a daughter, etc.&mdash;gets one of three shares, depending on her closeness to the deceased:</span></p><ol class="c23 lst-kix_list_3-0 start" start="1"><li class="c10 c24"><span class="c12">Less than a male&rsquo;s share</span><span class="c8">.

This </span><span class="c12">s&ucirc;rah</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;came at a time when the pagans of Arabia (and their allies) repeatedly violated treaties they had signed with the Prophet (&#65018;). Muslims had to fight for the survival of their newly established state in Medina. So this verse discusses dealing with those who violated their agreements and attacked the Muslims. Offenders were fought, unless they stopped their aggression.

There are several references in the Old Testament (e.g., Ezra 4:20). In the New Testament, Jesus allows paying taxes to Caesar (Luke 20:25). Under Islamic rule, all individuals had financial obligations&mdash;Muslims paid </span><span class="c12">zak&acirc;h</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;(2.5% of their savings) and non-Muslims (</span><span class="c12">&#11372;imm&icirc;s</span><span class="c8">) were required to pay </span><span class="c12">jizyah</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;(tax for protection from foreign enemies). The </span><span class="c12">jizyah</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;was an average of one dinar (4.25 g of gold) annually. Women, children, the elderly, the clergy, the poor, and those who were unable to work were exempt. Those who opted to join the army were also exempt. Poor </span><span class="c12">&#11372;imm&icirc;s</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;were supported financially by the state. Muslim rulers refunded the </span><span class="c12">jizyah</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;if they failed to protect their non-Muslim subjects.</span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref341" id="ftnt341">[341]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;When &rsquo;Adi ibn &#7716;&acirc;tim, a companion of the Prophet (&#65018;), heard this verse, he said, &ldquo;But the Jews and Christians do not worship their rabbis and monks!&rdquo; The Prophet (&#65018;) replied, &ldquo;Do the rabbis and monks not forbid the permissible and permit the forbidden, and they obey them?&rdquo; &rsquo;Adi answered, &ldquo;Yes, they do.&rdquo; The Prophet (&#65018;) concluded, &ldquo;This is how they worship them.&rdquo; Collected by At-Tirmi&#11372;i.</span></p></div><div><p class="c10"><a href="#ftnt_ref342" id="ftnt342">[342]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;i.e., religion of truth. </span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref343" id="ftnt343">[343]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;i.e., the Preserved Tablet in which everything is written. </span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref344" id="ftnt344">[344]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;The sacred months are the 11</span><span class="c15">th</span><span class="c8">, 12</span><span class="c15">th</span><span class="c8">, 1</span><span class="c15">st</span><span class="c8">, and 7</span><span class="c15">th</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;of the Islamic calendar.

The Prophet (&#65018;) received the news that a Roman army was being mobilized to launch an attack on the newly established Muslim state in Medina, so he announced that he was going to march to Tab&ucirc;k, located over 700 miles to the north, to meet the Romans in the summer of 9 A.H./631 C.E. It was a time of hardship because of the scorching heat, the long distance, and the financial situation of the Muslims. Although the Prophet (&#65018;) was able to mobilize over 30 000 Muslims for battle, many others did not join the army with or without valid excuses. Eventually, the Roman forces were discouraged from fighting and fled to Damascus and other cities under Roman rule. Therefore, the Prophet (&#65018;) returned to Medina with a feeling of triumph.

He (&#65018;) sent &rsquo;Uthm&acirc;n ibn &rsquo;Aff&acirc;n to let the Meccans know that the Muslims had come in peace, only to visit the Sacred House. When the Meccans delayed &rsquo;Uthm&acirc;n, the Prophet (&#65018;) thought they might have killed his envoy. So he (&#65018;) called upon the faithful to pledge allegiance to him under a tree at &#7716;udaibiyah in the outskirts of Mecca. Shortly after, &rsquo;Uthm&acirc;n returned safely and a peace agreement was signed by the Muslims and Meccan pagans, stating in part that the Muslims would have to return to Medina and come back next year for &rsquo;umrah. The Treaty of &#7716;udaibiyah is described as a clear triumph since it established peace, temporarily diffused the tension between the Muslims and the Meccan pagans, and gave the Muslims plenty of time to spread awareness and understanding of their faith. Thousands from different tribes accepted Islam during that truce.</span></p></div><div><p class="c10"><a href="#ftnt_ref999" id="ftnt999">[999]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">See</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;footnote for 47:19. </span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref1000" id="ftnt1000">[1000]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;i.e., that Allah will not support His Prophet (&#65018;) and that misfortune will befall the believers. </span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref1001" id="ftnt1001">[1001]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;Another possible translation: &ldquo;&hellip; so that you &#761;all&#762; may believe in Allah and His Messenger, support &#761;His cause&#762;, revere, and glorify Him morning and evening.&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref1002" id="ftnt1002">[1002]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;Those who pledged allegiance at &#7716;udaibiyah were promised by Allah that the spoils of war obtained from the Tribe of Khaibar would be exclusively theirs. </span></p></div><div><p class="c10"><a href="#ftnt_ref1003" id="ftnt1003">[1003]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;Meaning, you only say so to deprive us of our share. </span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref1004" id="ftnt1004">[1004]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;This refers to Haw&acirc;zin and Thaq&icirc;f, two pagan Arab tribes. </span></p></div><div><p class="c10"><a href="#ftnt_ref1005" id="ftnt1005">[1005]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;The conquest of Khaibar in 7 A.H./628 C.E.</span></p></div><div><p class="c10"><a href="#ftnt_ref1006" id="ftnt1006">[1006]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;Or the spoils of Khaibar. </span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref1007" id="ftnt1007">[1007]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;lit., turn their backs.</span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref1008" id="ftnt1008">[1008]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;A group of Meccans wanted to attack the Muslims on their way to Mecca, but were taken captive by the Muslims, then were released. </span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref1009" id="ftnt1009">[1009]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;The animals that Muslims had brought along to be sacrificed after completing the rituals of the minor pilgrimage (&rsquo;</span><span class="c12">umrah</span><span class="c8">). </span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref1010" id="ftnt1010">[1010]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;By doing so, the Meccan Muslims who were unknown to their fellow believers were safe, along with the pagans who later accepted Islam. </span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref1011" id="ftnt1011">[1011]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;This is when the pagans prevented the Prophet (&#65018;) and the believers from entering the Sacred House for &rsquo;</span><span class="c12">umrah</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;and the arrogance they showed when drafting the peace agreement. </span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref1012" id="ftnt1012">[1012]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;The declaration of faith that there is only one God to be worshipped and that Mu&#7717;ammad (&#65018;) is His Messenger.</span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref1013" id="ftnt1013">[1013]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;Pilgrims are required to shave or trim their hair upon successfully completing the rituals of pilgrimage.</span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref1014" id="ftnt1014">[1014]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;This refers to the Treaty of &#7716;udaibiyah and/or the gains of Khaibar before the fulfilment of the Prophet&rsquo;s vision to enter Mecca for &rsquo;</span><span class="c12">umrah</span><span class="c8">. </span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref1015" id="ftnt1015">[1015]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;This passage and the next should be understood in their historical context.
